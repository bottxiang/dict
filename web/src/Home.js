      Home...Health secretary Sajid Javid says 77,000 NHS workers remain
      unvaccinated Sajid Javid has said about 77,000 NHS workers have not been
      jabbed. He added it was the “professional duty of every NHS worker to get
      vaccinated”. Javid told the health and social care committee: Even before
      the mandate, the vast majority had [been jabbed]. Since the mandate, since
      we announced a consultation in September, we’ve had around 100,000 in the
      NHS that were unvaccinated at that point that have come forward. So
      there’s been a very good response. I think now almost 95% of NHS workers
      that have had at least one jab. The latest numbers I have is that around
      77,000 that have not. That is improving every day. I think it’s also
      reasonable to assume that not everyone ultimately is going to come
      forward. He said the NHS was asking trusts to set out the estimations for
      the staff who “will ultimately just not come forward, and then to break
      down what kind of roles they are and see how they would manage that”.
